# Space Background Generator

This is a tool I am developing for [my space game project](https://github.com/floomby/SpaceGame).

It uses opencl to generate large contiguous backgrounds of nebulas and stars and outputs them as a collection of png tiles.

The macro feature definition system is missing.
